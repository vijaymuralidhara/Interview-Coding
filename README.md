## Manhattan Distance
### Description
This program accepts two coordinate points and returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.
### Setup
1. Navigate to the location of the Manhattan.java file and compile the program using the following command: *javac Manhattan.java*
2. Next, run the program by executing the following command: *java Manhattan*
### Usage
1. After executing the program, you will be greeted with a short description of the program and a prompt to enter the first coordinate point.
* The entered coordinate point should be enclosed by parentheses. For example, to input the coordinate point x = 5, y = 4: (5,4)
* This program also accepts decimals. For example, to input the decimal coordinate point x = 5.5, y = 4.5: (5.5,4.5)
2. After entering the first coordinate point, you will be prompted to enter the second coordinate point.
3. Upon pressing enter, the program will print out the calculated Manhattan Distance between the two points.
4. To rerun the program with a different pair of coordinate points enter 'y', otherwise enter any other key to exit the program.

## Mustang Bronco GUI
### Description
This program is a user interface that accepts an integer from the user and displays a string value based on the following algorithm:
1. If the number is divisible by 3, displays “Mustang”.
2. If the number is divisible by 5, displays “Bronco”.
3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, displays “MustangBronco”.
4. For all other numbers, displays the number itself.
### Setup
1. Navigate to the location of the MustangBronco.java file and compile the program using the following command: *javac MustangBronco.java*
2. Next, run the program by executing the following command: *java MustangBronco*
### Usage
1. After executing the program, you will be greeted by a new popup window titled 'Mustang-Bronco GUI'.
2. Enter an integer in the text box and click the 'Run' button below to run the program.
* The entered integer must be a valid integer which has no trailing decimal point or letters. *For example, '5.0' is not a valid integer, instead simply enter '5'*
3. The program will output a result that follows the algorithm described in the program description above.
4. To exit out of the program, simply close the program window.
